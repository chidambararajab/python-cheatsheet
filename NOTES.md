🎉 Python Interview Mastery Course - COMPLETE!
I've created a comprehensive Python interview preparation system specifically designed for experienced developers (5+ YOE) with zero Python knowledge. Here's what you have:
📦 What Was Created (13 Files, 6,000+ Lines)
🎓 Training Files (7 Core Modules)
01_lists_comprehensive.py (26KB) - Dynamic arrays, slicing, two pointers
02_tuples_comprehensive.py (26KB) - Immutability, unpacking, dict keys
03_sets_comprehensive.py (28KB) - O(1) lookup, duplicate detection
04_dictionaries_comprehensive.py (30KB) - MOST IMPORTANT! Hash maps, Two Sum pattern
05_utility_functions.py (22KB) - enumerate, zip, join, sorted, any/all
06_practice_problems.py (27KB) - 10+ real interview problems with solutions
07_interview_patterns.py (29KB) - 7 core patterns (Two Pointers, Sliding Window, etc.)
📚 Documentation & Guides
START_HERE.md - Your first stop! 24-hour crash course + full learning path
README.md - Complete curriculum, week-by-week schedule, strategy
QUICK_REFERENCE.md - Syntax cheat sheet (keep this open during practice!)
INDEX.md - Complete course index with navigation
OVERVIEW.txt - Visual overview (displayed above)
🛠️ Tools
run_all.py - Interactive test runner to execute all training files
🚀 How to Get Started (3 Simple Steps)
Step 1: Choose Your Path
Path A: Emergency (24 hours before interview)

# Follow the 24-hour crash course in START_HERE.mdpython3 01_lists_comprehensive.py # Hour 1python3 04_dictionaries_comprehensive.py # Hour 2# ... continue with START_HERE.md

Path B: Quick Prep (1 week)

# Days 1-2: Core data structurespython3 01_lists_comprehensive.pypython3 04_dictionaries_comprehensive.pypython3 03_sets_comprehensive.py

Path C: Thorough (3 weeks) - RECOMMENDED

# Week 1: All data structures + utilities# Week 2: Patterns + LeetCode practice# Week 3: Mock interviews + advanced practice

Step 2: Run Your First File
cd /Users/chidambararajab/Documents/Chid/Development/Python/python-cheatsheetpython3 01_lists_comprehensive.py
You'll see comprehensive output with examples, narration, and patterns!
Step 3: Keep Reference Open

# Open in another window/tab for quick lookupsopen QUICK_REFERENCE.md

💡 Key Features That Make This Special

1. Interview Narration (Critical!)
   Every solution includes think-aloud narration:
   🎤 INTERVIEWER NARRATION:"I'll use a hash map to store values I've seen. For each element,I check if (target - element) exists in the map. This gives O(n)time instead of O(n²) brute force."
2. Multiple Solutions
   Brute force → Optimized → Pythonic
   Time & space complexity for each
   Common mistakes highlighted
3. Pattern Recognition Framework
   7 core patterns that solve 80% of interview problems:
   Two Pointers
   Sliding Window
   Hash Map
   Stack
   Binary Search
   Fast/Slow Pointers
   Dynamic Programming
4. Real Interview Problems
   Two Sum
   Valid Parentheses
   Group Anagrams
   Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
   Product of Array Except Self
   Maximum Subarray (Kadane's)
   And more!
   🎯 What You'll Master
   Data Structures
   ✅ Lists (90% of array problems)
   ✅ Dictionaries (70% of ALL problems)
   ✅ Sets (O(1) lookup power)
   ✅ Tuples (Immutability, dict keys)
   Pythonic Code
   ✅ List comprehensions
   ✅ enumerate() instead of range(len())
   ✅ zip() for parallel iteration
   ✅ join() for efficient string building
   ✅ get() with defaults for dicts
   Interview Skills
   ✅ Pattern recognition
   ✅ Think-aloud narration
   ✅ Time/space complexity analysis
   ✅ Edge case handling
   ✅ Optimization strategies
