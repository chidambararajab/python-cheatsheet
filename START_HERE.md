# 🚀 START HERE - Your Python Interview Journey

Welcome! You're about to learn Python from scratch, specifically for **clearing live coding interviews**.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### **Step 1: Test Your Setup**
```bash
python3 --version  # Should show Python 3.7+
```

### **Step 2: Run Your First File**
```bash

- Open QUICK_REFERENCE.md

---

## 🔥 24-Hour Crash Course

### **Hour 1: Lists (Most Common)**
```bash
python3 01_lists_comprehensive.py
```
**Focus on:**
- Slicing: `arr[start:end:step]`
- List comprehension: `[x for x in arr if condition]`
- Two pointers pattern
- Common methods: append, pop, sort

### **Hour 2: Dictionaries (Most Important!)**
```bash
python3 04_dictionaries_comprehensive.py
```
**Focus on:**
- `get(key, default)` - Never use `dict[key]` directly!
- `items()` for iteration
- Counter and defaultdict
- Two Sum pattern

### **Hour 3: Sets + Tuples**
```bash
python3 03_sets_comprehensive.py
python3 02_tuples_comprehensive.py
```
**Focus on:**
- Sets for O(1) lookup
- Tuples for dict keys
- Tuple unpacking: `a, b = b, a`

### **Hour 4: Utility Functions**
```bash
python3 05_utility_functions.py
```
**Focus on:**
- enumerate() - Use instead of range(len())
- zip() - Combine parallel arrays
- join() - Build strings efficiently
- sorted(key=...) - Custom sorting

### **Hours 5-8: Practice Problems**
```bash
python3 06_practice_problems.py
```
Work through ALL problems. Don't just read - code them yourself!

### **Hours 9-12: Interview Patterns**
```bash
python3 07_interview_patterns.py
```
**Master these 7 patterns:**
1. Two Pointers
2. Sliding Window
3. Hash Map
4. Stack
5. Binary Search
6. Fast/Slow Pointers
7. Dynamic Programming

### **Hours 13-24: LeetCode Practice**

**Solve these 20 problems in order:**

**Easy (Warm-up - 30 mins each):**
1. Two Sum
2. Valid Parentheses
3. Merge Two Sorted Lists
4. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
5. Valid Anagram

**Medium (Core - 45 mins each):**
6. Group Anagrams
7. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
8. Longest Palindromic Substring
9. Container With Most Water
10. 3Sum
11. Product of Array Except Self
12. Maximum Subarray
13. Merge Intervals
14. Rotate Image
15. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

**Hard (Challenge - 60 mins each):**
16. Trapping Rain Water
17. Merge K Sorted Lists
18. Longest Valid Parentheses
19. First Missing Positive
20. Word Ladder

**Use the narration style from the practice files!**
