## 🎤 Think-Aloud Excellence

### **What Strong Candidates Say:**

**Starting:**
- "Let me make sure I understand the problem..."
- "Can I clarify a few edge cases?"
- "Let me walk through an example first..."

**During:**
- "I'm noticing this is a sliding window problem..."
- "The brute force would be O(n²), let me optimize..."
- "I'll use a hash map for O(1) lookup..."

**Testing:**
- "Let me trace through this example..."
- "Edge case: what if the array is empty?"
- "This should handle duplicates because..."

**Struggling:**
- "I'm considering two approaches..."
- "Let me think about the trade-offs..."
- "Could you clarify the constraint about...?"

### **What Weak Candidates Say:**

❌ "This is hard" (complaining)
❌ "I've never seen this before" (making excuses)
❌ "Can I Google it?" (not interview-appropriate)
❌ [Silence for minutes] (no communication)
❌ "I don't know" (giving up)
